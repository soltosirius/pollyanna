# pollyanna

I believe the morning sun always gonna shine again and
I believe a pot of gold waits at every rainbow's end, oh
I believe in roses kissed with dew
Why shouldn't I believe the same in you?
I believe in make-believe, fairy tales and lucky charms and
I believe in promises spoken as you cross your heart, oh
I believe in skies forever blue
Why shouldn't I believe the same in you?
You may say I'm a fool feelin' the way that I do
You can call me Pollyanna, say I'm crazy as a loon
I believe in silver linings
And that's why I believe in you
I believe there'll come a day
Maybe it will be tomorrow
When the blue bird flies away
All we have to do is follow
I believe a dream can still come true
Why shouldn't I believe the same in you
You may say I'm a fool feelin' the way that I do
I believe in friends and laughter
And the wonders love can do
I believe in songs and magic
And that's why I believe in you
You may say I'm a fool feelin' this way about you
There's not much I can do
I'm gonna be this way my life through
'Cause I still believe in miracles, I swear I've seen a few
And the time will surely come when you can see my point of view
I believe in second chances
And that's why I believe in you
